# ISS Pass Overhead

The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is a space station in low Earth orbit. The ISS programme is a joint project between five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.

## Inspiration
I have this habit of exploring the night sky with the help of mobile apps like
[Star Walk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/star-walk-2-night-sky-map/id892279069)
. Space has always been a subject of fascination for me.

The ISS circles the Earth in roughly 92 minutes and completes 15.5 orbits per
day. I collected this data with the help of [IFTTT mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635).
